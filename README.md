DDP-Project-Codes
=================

Codes used to build the Shiny App

1. First of all, we create our ui.R code.
2. On this code, we put a name to our project with headerPanel command.
3. We create our inputs which will be used for users to enter. In this case Temperature and Wind will be our input plus a submmit buttom.
4. Using a mainPanel command, we can display values entered for the user and see our predicted value, in this case "Ozone".
5. Secondly, we create our server.R code.
6. First of all, we specify our function which display our prediction.
7. Finally, we create our outputs to be display on the application.

Once on the application, it is easy to use:

1. Enter a temperature value
2. Enter a Wind value
3. These 2 variables will allow you to see your ozone estimation
